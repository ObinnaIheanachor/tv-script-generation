Generating Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs

This repository contains my work for the Generating [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs project from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. You'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Data
This project uses part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons
